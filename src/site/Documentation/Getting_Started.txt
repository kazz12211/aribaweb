This guide describes how to install the AribaWeb distribution, get up and running with
the examples, and start building your own application.


Installation
------------

The AribaWeb distribution .zip archive contains everything you need to get running
(including Ant, Tomcat, and the HSQLDB Java database libraries) -- all you need is
a valid installation of the Java5 or Java6 *JDK* (not just the JRE).

  1. Install the Java5 or Java6 JDK (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp)
        > set your JAVA_HOME (e.g. on Unix: `export JAVA_HOME="d:/jdk1.5"`,
         on Windows set JAVA_HOME in your System Control Panel Advanced -> Environment Variables panel)

  2. Unzip the aribaweb.zip to an appropriate directory.
        > **Note:** Unzip to a path without any spaces in any parent directory names. --- i.e. on Windows unzip to d:/
          rather than to your Desktop or Documents folders (both of which are in a folder called "Documents and Settings")

Running The Examples
--------------------

  1. **Double-click in `aribaweb/bin` directory on `start`** (or, on Windows, `start.bat`)

  2. There is no step 2.  :-)


If all goes according to plan, the examples webapps will be packed, tomcat will launch, and your browser
will open to the Demo App [http://localhost:9080/Demo/AribaWeb](http://localhost:9080/Demo/AribaWeb).
From there you can click around the app, browse and search the online documentation, and see the
source code behind the examples with Component Inspector (just Alt-click on any UI element).

One other example app will launch as well:

  - **[MasterDetail](http://localhost:9080/MasterDetail/AribaWeb)** --  a MetaUI database app
    which includes AppCore (User, Group, Permission) and Compass text search.  (Note: for full functionality
    in MasterDetail, click the login link and login as Admin/ariba)


Also included in the examples directory are:

  - **GuestBook** -- a trivial guest book app.

  - **AtIssue**, an email-integrated bug tracker.  To run AtIssue you'll need to set up a GMail account to use as
    your bug IMAP inbox, and configure AtIssue to point at it.  See the instructions in examples/AtIssue/README.txt
    for more info.

You can cd into to these source directories and run `aw ant launch` to build and run each of these

### Troubleshooting ###

Several configuration issues could prevent the examples from launching correctly:

  - Your JAVA_HOME is not set correctly, or points to a JRE (rather than JDK), or your JDK is 1.3 or 1.4
    (rather than the required 1.5 or 1.6)

  - You installed AW to a path where a parent directory has spaces

  - You have an ANT_HOME defined and it points to an old version of Ant (e.g. 1.6 or 1.7.0, rather than 1.7.1)
          > **Note:** AribaWeb includes Ant 1.7.1 as part of its distribution.  You are best off clearing your ANT_HOME
            environment variable and letting AW use its bundled Ant

  - You have TOMCAT_HOME, CATALINA_HOME or CATALINA_BASE environment variables defined, and they point
    to an old or customized installation.
          > **Note:** AribaWeb includes Tomcat 6 as part of its distribution.  On initialization, the AW build files
            copy the CATALINA_HOME/conf directory and try to update the webserver port in the copied server.xml (to 9080).
            If you have tweaked your server.xml, for instance, AW's attempts to change the port may fail and the app
            may start on a different port (in which case you'll need to access the apps with a different port in you
            URL)

  - You get a debugger port conflict on start up
          > By default AW launches the examples with the debugger enabled and set to listen on port 9000.  If you have
          another process using that port the server will fail to start.

  - Everything launched and AW says that it's opening the browser to http://localhost:9080/Demo/AribaWeb,
    but the browser doesn't open
          > The auto browser launch feature works only on Mac and Windows and has been known to fail on certain
            Windows machines.  If your browser does not launch, simply manually point your browser at http://localhost:9080/Demo/AribaWeb.

Building your Own App
---------------------

You can create a new AW app by Double-clicking in `aribaweb/bin` directory on **`aw`** (or, on Windows, `aw.bat`)
and then respond to the shell prompt with 'c' to create a new application.  From there simply answer the on screen
instructions to provide an app name, choose a template, and provide class and package names.  When you're done you
can choose to have the new project opened in your IDE, or launched build and launched immediately.
