AribaWeb Release History
========================

AribaWeb has been a commercially deployed component of Ariba, Inc's network services
(e.g. [Ariba Supplier Network](http://supplier.ariba.com),
[Ariba Discovery](http://discovery.ariba.com))
and On Demand [Spend Management application suite](http://www.ariba.com/solutions/) since
late 1999.  The framework evolved steadily in dozens of releases over that time,
and was first released as Open Source in May 2008.

Below is a brief history of the major releases of the framework:

AribaWeb 5
----------

The first Open Source release of AribaWeb.  Initially released in beta form in May 1999,
AW5 was the first release packaged for external consumption.  Major enhancements included:

  - Ant build system

  - Zero configuration initialization (jar scanning based resource registration)

  - MetaUI and MetaDB frameworks
    (Ariba has employed a related metadata-driven UI framework, called "fieldsui",
    since 1999, but MetaUI is a new design).


AribaWeb 4
----------

AribaWeb 4 premiered as part of Ariba's next generation On Demand applications in 2006.
Key new capabilities included:

  - Cross-page Incremental Refresh
    (Incremental refresh was now employed for essentially all responses, even those
    crossing server page boundaries)

  - PivotTables (multi-dimensional data display)

  - Client-side modal panels

  - Enhanced validation error display and navigation

  - AWPoll (simulated push) support

  - RichText editor integration

  - Component Inspector


AribaWeb 3
----------

First released as part of Ariba Analysis in 2003, AW 3 included major steps forward
in client-side richness, including:

  - Drag and drop support

  - Scrolling Data Tables (with incremental data fetching)

  - Outline trees (and tables)

  - Pervasive refresh regions (all requests were JavaScript-based and could result
    in incremental page updates)

  - LazyDiv (lazy fetching popup menus)


AribaWeb 2
----------

Released as part of Sourcing 4.0 (and later Buyer 8.0), AW 2.0 was the first release
to include formally packaged "widgets" (and wizard) frameworks.  New capabilities included:

  - Many widgets: TabSet, PopupMenu, TextButton, Section

  - Wizard framework (and ActionInterceptor model)

  - Branding framework (including custom page wrappers session-scoped resource managers)

  - Support for subtemplates (inner components)


AribaWeb 1
----------

First commercially deployed in October 1999 as part of the AribaNetwork 13 release,
and subsequently in ANME (then IBX) and Ariba Buyer 7.0 releases, AW 1.0 included:

  - Full component framework, including stateful and stateless components

  - Initial "refresh region" (auto AJAX) support for incrementally refreshing
    portions of a DOM in response to specifically flagged action elements.

  - Proper back-button support (via server-maintained page history)
