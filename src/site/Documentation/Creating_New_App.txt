AribaWeb includes new project templates that make getting started
with your first application quite easy.

Before Getting Started
----------------------

1. Open a shell window (e.g. Windows cygwin/MKS window, or MacOS X / Linux Terminal)

2. Make sure that you have the bin directory of you aribaweb installation in your PATH.
e.g. if you unpacked AW in your home directory:

        export PATH="~/aribaweb-5.0/bin:$PATH"


Creating a Widgets App
----------------------

Let's say we want to create a simple, one page, "guest book" sample.

1. First, change your current working directory to where you'd like to put your new project.

        cd ~/projects


2. Now we'll run the AW create-project command to create our project from a template

        % aw create-project

3. At the prompts, choose the "Basic Widgets Application" and enter
reasonable values for the application name ("GuestBook") and source code
package ("app")

	
        Please choose a template from among the following:
            [1] Basic AribaWeb/Widgets Application
                   A starter template for a basic (non-database)
                   AribaWeb application that uses the Widgets library.
            ...
        Selection [1]:
        1

        Enter name/path for your project (directory) [MyApp]:
        GuestBook

        Java package to use for your AW components/pages [app]:
        app

4. cd into your new project and run it

        cd GuestBook
        aw ant launch

The browser will automatically open and connect to your app.

5. Take a look at the source code in your IDE / Text editor of choice.

  - `app/Main.awl` is the AW template for the main page

  - `app/Main.java` is the corresponding component definition

  - `build.xml` is your build files.  Note that it includes a parent build file from
      your AW installation (the AW_HOME environment varaible is being set for you by
      the "aw" command that you used to run Ant

6. Try out modifications to the files

  - add some basic HTML to the .awl file and refresh the page in your browser
