**AribaWeb makes creating compelling, professional-grade web applications fast and fun.**

AribaWeb enables the creation of rich, highly interactive business applications with far less coding effort than
alternative web application development frameworks.  Among the key attributes that set AribaWeb apart:

![AribaWeb AutoAJAX](hero/AutoAJAX.gif)
Auto AJAX!
==========
Today's users demand a highly interactive, rich user experience from their web applications. To date, this challenge
has been met primarily through AJAX, but implementing AJAX typically involves the extensive (and expensive) hand-coding
of brittle client-side JavaScript code.  With [Auto AJAX]#, AribaWeb completely changes the game and dramatically alters
the cost equation:  AJAX user interfaces -- complete with drag and drop, incremental page refresh, type ahead choosers,
etc -- are produced automatically, without requiring the application developer to
perform any client-side scripting.

![AribaWeb Instant App](hero/InstantApp.gif)
Instant App
===========
Business applications typically consist of hundreds of user interface screens built to support the creation, editing,
search and inspection of the "business objects" that encode the business functionality.  In most frameworks, the user
interface developer must create and maintain user interface code for each of these screens.  AribaWeb's "Instant App"
technology eliminates the need for this code.  In fact, given only a set of UI-agnostic Java or Groovy domain classes,
AribaWeb can apply rules to the available meta-data and instantly derive a fully functional application, all without a
single line of application UI code.  This all part of the AribaWeb declarative programming model that delivers
More app with [Way Less Code]#.

Live Edit & X-Ray
=================
AribaWeb's focus on developer productivity is further evidenced through its Live Edit and X-Ray capabilities.
Developers use [X-Ray]# to "see through" running application UIs, getting visibility to the active hierarchy of components
behind the scenes.  Further, with Live Edit, developers can use drag and drop to alter the UI layout and property sheets
to tweak rules right in the browser. All changes take immediate effect in the live application.

The same holds true for edits to source code.  With [Rapid Turnaround]#, edits to UI templates (.awl), metaui
rules (.oss), as well as Java or Groovy source files are reloaded automatically, without a disruptive server
restart.

![AribaWeb Proven Full Stack](hero/FullStack.gif)
Proven Full Stack
=================
The AribaWeb distribution provides a full stack for the development of database-based business applications, including
a deep library of [Rich Widgets]# (forms, pivot tables, charts, rich text editors, etc.) as well as bindings to a bundled
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) database framework, and supports deployment in a variety of J2EE environments.  And
AribaWeb is [Enterprise Proven]# technology. Now in its fifth major release, AribaWeb has been included by Ariba as a
critical component of its market-leading Spend Management solutions and Network Services for nearly a decade.
AribaWeb is used daily by millions of users at more than a thousand of the world's largest enterprises, and has been
part of over one trillion dollars of business-to-business electronic commerce.
